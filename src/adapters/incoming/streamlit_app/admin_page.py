"""Admin page module (deprecated -- admin now uses the chat interface).

The admin sidebar panel has been replaced by inline chat widgets.
Admin users interact with the chatbot and see approve/reject buttons
rendered directly within the conversation.

This module is kept for backward compatibility but is no longer used
by the main application.
